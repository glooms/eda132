Run the program with by writing:

	python main.py

You can also give it parameters to disable/enable printing.

E.g.

	python main.py 15 1 1 0.25

The first argument is how many steps are to be taken by the robot before
the program terminates.

The second argument enables printing info, meaning it will print what
state the robot is in, what state is perceived through the noisy sensors
and what is thought to be the state through the algorithm.

The third argument enbables printing three grids which visually
represent the three states actual, perceived and thought.

The fourth argument is a float, giving the amount of time the program
should sleep in seconds after each step so that the visualized grid can
be viewed more easily.

Default settings, while running

	python main.py

are equivalent to running

	python main.py 15 0 0 0

The program always outputs a message regarding accuracy with a format
like:

	n: x1 x2 x3 x4

Where n is the number of steps and x1..n are how many squares the most
likely state is from the actual state at step 1..n. This is the computed
manhattan distance.
